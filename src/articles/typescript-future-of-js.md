## The Irreversible Shift to Type Safety

Just a few years ago, **TypeScript** was a choice. Today, for any serious **Web Development** or **Software Engineering** project, it's a requirement. The benefits far outweigh the initial learning curve.

### Benefits Beyond Bug Catching

1.  **Refactoring Confidence:** Safely make large-scale changes without fear of breaking distant modules.
2.  **Superior Tooling:** IDEs offer better code completion and navigation due to explicit type information.
3.  **Readability:** Code is instantly self-documenting because the types tell you exactly what data is expected.
