## When to use NextJS and When to use Gatsby

**NextJS** and **Gatsby** have defined the modern landscape for **Frontend Engineer** work using **React**. While both deliver exceptional performance, they operate on different principles:

### NextJS: Dynamic and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

NextJS excels at dynamic content. It offers various rendering methods, including SSR, which renders the page on the server *per request*. This is ideal for applications requiring real-time data or user authentication.

### Gatsby: Static Site Generation (SSG)

Gatsby is focused on SSG, pre-building every page into static HTML files during the build process. It's unbeatable for speed and security on marketing sites or blogs that change infrequently, often relying on **Headless CMS** data sources.

The choice depends on the project's content speed and complexity. A skilled **Full-Stack Developer** can advise on the best fit for your specific **Web Development** needs.
