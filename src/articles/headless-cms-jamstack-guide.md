## Decoupling Content: The Power of Headless CMS

The **Headless CMS** model has fundamentally changed how we approach content management. By separating the content repository from the presentation layer, developers gain immense flexibility and performance boosts. This shift is central to modern **Web Development**.

### Why Choose Headless?

1.  **Flexibility:** Content can be pushed to any device or application (web, mobile, IoT).
2.  **Performance:** Headless sites often integrate with the **JAMstack** architecture, relying on CDN caching for lightning-fast speeds.

### The NextJS and Gatsby Connection

Frameworks like **NextJS** and **Gatsby** are perfectly suited for this model. They act as the **Frontend Engineer** layer, pulling content from the Headless CMS via API calls.
