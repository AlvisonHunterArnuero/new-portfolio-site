## The Foundation of Web Services: Data Modeling

Effective **Backend Development** starts with smart data modeling. Poorly designed databases lead to slow queries and complex application logic. In the **Node.js** ecosystem, developers frequently choose between relational databases (like PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).

### Relational (SQL)

Best for applications requiring complex transactions, strong consistency, and defined relationships. Requires careful planning but provides strong data integrity.

### NoSQL

Best for rapid iteration, horizontal scaling, and large volumes of non-structured data (like social media feeds).
